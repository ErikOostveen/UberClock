# UberClock

A smart MIDI master clock designed for synth jam sessions (up to 6 people). This master clock, and its MIDI distribution boxes, ensures that anyone in the jam session always -and automatically- start at the downbeat keeping everything and everyone nicely in sync. The Restart feature allows for an on-the-fly re-sync of all gear in case one or more participants start to run out of sync.
